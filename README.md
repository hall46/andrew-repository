This repository includes my homework assignments for DACSS-601: Fundamentals to Data Science. At my job, I am collaborating with a group of researchers on quantifying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on occupations in Massachusetts. Before we could get started, I needed to find a data source that would provide us with 1) monthly data, 2) occupational detail that would enable us to identify which occupations required in-person work and regular interactions with the general public, and 3) geographic detail that would allow us analyze the state (and possibly counties). After a lot of trial and error, I came across the Current Population Survey microdata which are provided by IPUMS (https://cps.ipums.org/cps/).  I used this opportunity to explore the CPS data set in R and see whether it would work for this project. In these homeworks, I transformed the raw, unweighted data into cleaned and weighted data and experimented with different ways of checking and verifying the data to ensure that they were making sense. Through these assignments, I was able to confirm that the CPS data will work for my project. My next step will be crosswalking the occupational categories to the data and conducting some preliminary analysis on the impacts of the pandemic by occupation.
